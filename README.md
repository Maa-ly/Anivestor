# **Anivestor**

Anivestor is a **decentralized investment platform** focused on **livestock (animal) investment**. The platform allows **farmers** to list their livestock for investment, where **investors** can purchase shares in the animals. Investors then receive **daily returns** based on the profits generated by the livestock, making it a unique blend of **agricultural investment** and **blockchain technology**.

Anivestor enables a decentralized marketplace where people can invest in livestock and earn passive income through profit-sharing. It aims to democratize livestock investments and provide farmers with easier access to funding while giving investors a chance to diversify their portfolios.

## **Key Features**

### **Livestock Investment**
- Farmers can register and list livestock (e.g., cattle, poultry) and sell shares to investors.
- Investors can buy shares in the livestock and earn a portion of the daily profits generated from the animals.

### **Profit Sharing**
- Investors earn daily profits proportional to the number of shares they own. The profit is calculated and distributed daily.
- Farmers use the funds raised from share sales to support their livestock.

### **Whitelist Mechanism**
- Livestock listings are either **public** (open to anyone) or **private** (restricted to verified users), governed by a whitelist system to manage access.

### **Collateral & Borrowing**
- Farmers can borrow funds to finance their livestock projects, providing collateral in the form of livestock shares. This ensures that the investors are paid their returns.
